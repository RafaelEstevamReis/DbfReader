# DBF Reader

## Context

This repository is the result of a challenge to implement and old and outdated format, witch I choose DBF tables to

As of today is possible to read a table and export a DataTable from it

This code does **NOT** write to DBF files and do **not** support indexes nor queries

If you need to use this as a lib to read some old data, I publish it on NuGet [![NuGet](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Simple.DBF)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Simple.DBF)

## Table Viewer

There is a "Viewer" project you can use to visualy inspect the files
